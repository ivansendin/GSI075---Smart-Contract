  @title LUPA: Lowest-Unmatched Price Auction

  This is a first try of an LUPA Smart Contract. More about this kind of auction can be found in:

  Lowest-Unmatched Price Auctions.  JÃ¼rgen Eichberger and Dmitri Vinogradov
  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167718715000752

  One limitation of this SC is that everyone can see the bids.
  Once the SC is delivered, one can view its transactions and data using services like https://etherscan.io/.
  We will solve this in the next week...

  By now, you can see that the BidValue struct was poorly designed: the array in bidders is not necessary, as much as the uint value.

  Try to remove these issues and measure the impact on the cost of gas...be carefull!
