In this task you will have to create a vanity address for Ethereum.
The beginning of the address must be the same as your registration number (eg.0xBCC999).
Don't forget to write down the "secret" as this address will be used in the course.
This is basically a brute force task, choosing a suitable (compiled!) language will help to reduce search time.
Remember that this task is easily parallelizable.
